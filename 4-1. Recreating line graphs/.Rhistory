# There are many ways to create a line chart in R. For this exercise, you'll use the very basic plot() function. The syntax is â
#   plot(v,type,col,xlab,ylab,main)
#     v - is an object (a "vector") containing the numeric values.
#     type - use "p" to draw only points, "l" to draw only lines and "o" to draw both points and lines.
#     xlab - is the label for x axis.
#     ylab - is the label for y axis.
#     main is the Title of the chart.
#     col is the color of the points and lines.
#     lwd is the thickness of the lines (it takes a number without quotes around it)
#     ylim can be used to specify the lower and upper limits of the y axis (with rare exception,  you should always start the y axis at zero)
#         the form is this: ylim = c(0,<insert upper limit number here>)
# You'll draw one line at a time so to prepare for that you need to create new objects that contain the data for just 1 line
#     (in this case, one set for each level of education).
# The first line below says "create an object called 'bachelors' and fill it with a subset of the object
#   called "myData" that has the text 'Bachelor's degree or more' in the column called 'education'":
bachelors <- subset(myData, myData$education == "Bachelor's degree or more")
highSchool <- subset(myData, myData$education == "High school graduate")
twoYear <- subset(myData, myData$education == "Two-year degree/Some college")
# Now we want to get just the income values for each line (each education level).
# The first line below says "create an object called 'bachelorsIncome' and fill it with the contents of the "income" colum in the "bachelors" object
bachelorsIncome<-bachelors$income
highSchoolIncome<-highSchool$income
twoYearIncome<-twoYear$income
# Now draw the chart and first line with the plot function
plot(highSchoolIncome,type = "o",col = "#d1a72b", xlab = "cohort", ylab = "income", main = "value of education", ylim=c(0,45000),lwd =5)
